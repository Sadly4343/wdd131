    <title>Backwater Fishing Guides</title>

    <h1>Site Name - Backwater Fishing Guides</h1>
    <p>This was chosen because I found it to be a creative name for fishing and offered a great way to have a short and exact naem for the company.</p>
    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>The site purpose is to provide a fishing destination website that is easily accesible towards clients and offer a wide range of selections with information for fishing guides.</p>
    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Why are you the best fishing source? <br>
        Where can I sign up for my fishing trip?</p>
    <h2>Color Schema</h2>
    <p>The color scheme that I will use is going to be green and red as they are complementary and provide a great color to match the fish and often times resembles fisherman colors. I will use 
        red in the background and use green in the paragraphs and background colors with the header and background being red so create a complementary color scheme with the lettering staying as black for now.
    </p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>  
    <p>The choice I made was Exo 2 and this is the current typography for this site because I find it to fit the website I am developing and creates an easier to read and more likeable site that provides
        the user with a better understanding and connection to the what is being presented.
